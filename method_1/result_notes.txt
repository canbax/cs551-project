- I tried SVR with rbf, poly, sigmoid and linear. The best is linear. Linear gives some negative results.
- equal weighted average of with maximum bayes with SVR gives worse then only SVR
- weighted average of with maximum bayes with SVR gives better then only SVR with coeffients 0.08 and 0.92
- set bayes extimation as weighted average not maximum gives better error but together with SVR no improvement
