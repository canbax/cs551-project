- I tried SVR with rbf, poly, sigmoid and linear. The best is linear. Linear gives some negative results.
- equal weighted average of with maximum bayes with SVR gives worse then only SVR
- weighted average of with maximum bayes with SVR gives better then only SVR with coeffients 0.08 and 0.92
- set bayes extimation as weighted average not maximum gives better error but together with SVR no improvement
- using dummy variables for categorical causes overfitting/unstability cuz std increases
    - on kernel 1 with dummies (categorical to numeric) rmsle: 0.00798 with std:0.0010
    - on kernel 1 without dummies rmsle: 0.00897 with std:0.00087
