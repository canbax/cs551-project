feature selection

	- find correlation of feature pairs
	- find correlation of each feature with price
	- from highly correlated feature pairs, remove 1 feature which has lower correlation with price
	- log transformation to features for observing more 'normal' distribution
    - some numerical features are ACTUALLY categorical features
    - remove outliars
    - boxcox1p transformation to remove skewness, skewness harms normal distribution and so also linear model
